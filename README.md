# apa.cor - A correlation matrix in R, using APA style

/github/last-commit/:user/:repo

## What it does:

This single-function package is designed to be a fast way of creating a
correlation matrix from a dataframe that includes the needed variables.
It also produces means, standard deviations and NHS significance tests
at various levels, with an export function for the clipboard.

It is also a good tool of creating an S3 object that plugs in well into
the the `papaja: Prepare APA Journal Articles with R Markdown` package,
to produce a correlation table afer the APA manuscript guidelines (6th
Edition).

# Installation

To install the latest (see latest changes below), type the following
commands into the R console:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("GGLuca/apa.cor")
```

## Example of Recommended Usage

To create a correlation matrix for the Agreeableness items from the
`bfi`dataset (`psych` package, 25 Personality items representing 5
factors):

``` r
library(tidyverse)    # load Tidyverse
library(psych)        # load package psych for the `bfi`dataset
library(apa.cor)

bfi %>% 
  select(A1:A5) %>% 
  apa.cor()
```

    ##       M   SD      1     2     3     4
    ## A1 2.41 1.41                         
    ## A2 4.80 1.17 -.34**                  
    ## A3 4.60 1.30 -.27** .49**            
    ## A4 4.70 1.48 -.15** .34** .36**      
    ## A5 4.56 1.26 -.18** .39** .50** .31**

## Supplemental Argument

The function also has an export option `export = TRUE`, that copies the
output into the clipboard, for further manipulation such a simple paste
into Microsoft Word.

## Better usage

Since the function outputs a proper S3 object, it is perfect for
integrating it into the [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja)
package.

``` r
library(papaja)

bfi %>% 
  select(A1:A5) %>% 
  apa.cor() %>% 

apa_table(
  .,
  , caption = "Variable Means and Correlations Between Agreeableness Items"
  , note = "This table was created with apa_table()."
  , escape = TRUE
)
```
